# Simple_Calculator_AndroidApp
Simple calculator Android app made in AndroidStudio and Kotlin.

You could clone the repo and open the project in Android Studio.

To test the calculator, I connect my smartphone and hit play, so it would download the app on it.

The calculator can perform the four basic operations:
  -Sum
  -Substraction
  -Multiplication
  -Division
  
  There is also a CE button to clear the input.
